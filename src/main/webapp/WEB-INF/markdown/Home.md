===============
   
PolyMarker is an automated bioinformatics pipeline for SNP assay development which increases the probability of generating homoeologue-specific assays for polyploid wheat. PolyMarker generates a multiple alignment between the target SNP sequence and the IWGSC chromosome survey sequences ([IWGSC, 2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1251788) ) for each of the three wheat genomes. It then generates a mask with informative positions which are highlighted with respect to the target genome.
