Designed Primers
================

The following files contain designed primers to known markers

Wheat iSelect 90k
-----------------
The markers in this section are from the Illumina iSelect chip described in Wang (2014)[1] 

* **[Located against CSS](files/iSelect/primers_all.csv.zip)** 81,587 SNPs located according to the best hit to the scaffolds from the IWGSC[2] 
* **[Genetically mapped](files/iSelect/primers_in_map.csv.zip)** 46,977 SNPs located according to the genetic map.

The primers were designed against the soft-masked reference as released in [ensembl plants IWGSC1](http://plants.ensembl.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)

Wheat Axiom 820k
----------------
The Axiom chip was developed by the WISP, for further information go [here](http://www.cerealsdb.uk.net/cerealgenomics/CerealsDB/axiom_820K_search.php)
  
* **[Located against CSS](http://polymarker.tgac.ac.uk/files/820k_axiom/all_axiom_markers.csv.zip)** The marker is located to the best alignment from the [IWGSC scaffolds](https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/download/iwgsc/) and the same reference was used for the primer design.
