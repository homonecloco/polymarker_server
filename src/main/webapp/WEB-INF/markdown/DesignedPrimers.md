Designed Primers
================

The following files contain designed primers to known markers

Wheat iSelect 90k
-----------
The markers in this section are from the Illumina iSelect chip described in Wang (2014)[^1]

* **Located against CSS** 81,587 SNPs located according to the best hit to the scaffolds from the IWGSC[^2] 
* **Genetically mapped** 46,977 SNPs located according to the genetic map.

The primers were designed against the soft-masked reference as released in [ensembl plants IWGSC1](http://plants.ensembl.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index)
